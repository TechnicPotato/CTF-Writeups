# DUCTF 2020 Overall Writeup
Writeup of the Down Under CTF 2020.

## Thoughts
As the first CTF I have seriously participated in (Google CTF was too difficult). 
*Reversing* challenges proved too difficult and probably need more research on how the items worked.

*Forensics* was great fun, and learned alot about file descriptors and hiding items within images. 

*OSInt* was a frustrating experience to say the least, where I struggled with formatting of responses and deciphering clues.

Various other tasks such as *Web Exploits*, *Crypto* and *Pwn* I know too little about, but would work on for Future CTFs.

Overall, it was great fun and totally worth staying up all night for.

## Things learnt
From Google CTF I learnt more about file descriptors, which I applied here in forensics challenges to assist. A lot more was learnt about

Various items:
* Use of file desciption tools like `file` and `exiftool` to look at metadata.
* Hex editing using Hex Workshop in order to alter file descriptors
* Use of Google Lens as a better image recognition tool
* Distancing and waypoints on Google Maps as a searching radius recogniser

## Completed Challenges and General Thoughts
* ***Forensics*** was the area I found the easiest, and thus stuck to these challenges for most of the CTF.
* **On the Spectrum**: See `OnTheSpectrum.md`.
* **Spot the Difference**: See `SpotTheDifference.md`.
* **I Love Scomo**: See `ILoveScomo.md`.

* ***OSINT***
* **Off The Rails** : Frustrating experience, to say the least. Heavy use of google maps satellite data was poor with struggling internet, though `exiftool` proved to be useful in metadata extraction.
* **Off The Rails 3** : Poor flag formatting regarding cereal, otherwise interesting riddle involving underground locations. 


## Finale
As a final item, thank you to the DUCTF organisers and team for holding the event, alongside Team `birds aren't real` for being great teammates.
If this event is repeated, I would definitely look forward to participating in the future.
